# Android Implementation of Kinashe 

This is a mobile application designed to display information collected from companies at kinashe.com 
(see KinasheWebApp repo for details) to users. For its primary screens, it allows the user to translate
the page to Amharic, the native tongue in Ethiopia, and translation accuracy is ensured since companies 
upload translations along with the English version of their promotions.

## Home Page

From the home page, which displays companies that have paid to appear there, the user can select a company
and view its deals. Here, the user can translate the page to Amharic by clicking the button in the top right.

## Search Page

On the search tab, the user can quickly find a company by name and navigate straight to its selection of deals.

From the tabs marked by a pin and a bus icon, the user can browse categories of places or transportation methods,
respectively. Once a category is selected, the user can choose to view nearby businesses of that category (if they
have enabled location services) or all businesses of that category.
